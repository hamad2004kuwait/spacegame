Integration Test 1: setup() and movePlayer(char move)

Test Steps:
1. Initialize the game by calling setup().
2. Verify that the player starts at position (0,0) and has full fuel (MAX_FUEL).
3. Call printMap() to visually confirm that resources ('R') and asteroids ('X') are placed on the map.
4. Simulate a move command toward a known empty space using movePlayer('d').
5. Confirm that the player's position updates correctly and fuel is reduced by 1.
6. Simulate a move command toward a resource ('R') using movePlayer('s') and confirm resource collection.
7. Simulate an invalid move attempt outside the map boundary and ensure proper handling without crashing.
8. Simulate a move onto an asteroid ('X') and confirm the game exits as expected.

Expected Outcome:
- The program should initialize the map, player, and resources correctly through setup().
- Functions should correctly integrate to move the player, update the map, adjust fuel, and detect collisions or resource pickups.

Result: PASSED
